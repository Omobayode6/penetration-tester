## Intro to Offensive Security
Hack your first website (legally in a safe environment) and experience an ethical hacker's job.  
offensive security is the process of breaking into computer systems, exploiting software bugs, and finding loopholes in applications to gain unauthorized access to them.   
On the flip side, there is also defensive security, which is the process of protecting an organization's network and computer systems by analyzing and securing any potential digital threats.  

### Hacking your first machine
We will use a command-line application called "GoBuster"  
Type the following command into the terminal to find potentially hidden pages on FakeBank's website using GoBuster (a command-line security application).

```gobuster -u http://fakebank.com -w wordlist.txt dir```
